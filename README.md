# CoVID-19-Analysis-and-Prediction-Using-LSTM

This code uses the <b>COVID-19 dataset from John Hopkins university</b> from date <b>January 22, 2020 to April 17, 2020.</b> <br>

Data Exploration and Visualization is conducted using pandas and matplotlib. Trends are observed in the spread of the virus in select countries, and also the world as a whole. <br>

<b>Recurrent neural network (Long Short-term Memory) models</b> are trained on this time-series data and the trained model is used to generate future predictions. I designed various LSTM models for learning the current trends and predicting the future (20-day) trends of the virus spread in Italy and the World.
