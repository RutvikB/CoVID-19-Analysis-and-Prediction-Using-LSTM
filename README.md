# CoVID-19-Analysis-and-Prediction-Using-LSTM

This code uses the COVID-19 dataset from John Hopkins university from date January 22, 2020 to April 17, 2020. <br>

I've performed Data Exploration and Visualization on the Novel Coronavirus (CoVID-19) Dataset made available publicly by John Hopkins University. <br>

The dataset is used for analysis and visualization of the trends observed in the spread of the virus in select countries, and also the world as a whole. <br>

Recurrent neural networks are used to generate future predictions. I designed various LSTM models for learning the current trends and predicting the future (20-day) trends of the virus spread in Italy and the World.
